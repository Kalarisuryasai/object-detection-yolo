Real object recognition with voice output involves detecting and recognizing real-world objects in a physical environment and then outputting the results as speech. This can be useful for visually impaired individuals. Once objects have been detected and recognized, the system can use text-to-speech technology to output the results as speech. image recognition model that is pre-trained to identify up to 120 different everyday objects.
